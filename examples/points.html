    <h1>Points</h1>
    <p>
      This example generates concentric rectangles by picking points on the
      edges using a predefined ratio between the points. This illustrates the
      use of points (e.g. <code>{x: 0, y: 0}</code>) in Albert's classes and
      helpers, such as <code>Path</code> and <code>eq</code>.
